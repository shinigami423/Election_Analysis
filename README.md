# Election Analysis

## Purpose
Seth and Tom asks for the submission for the election audit results and complete the additional data requested by the election commission. The additional information includes the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and report the county with th ehighest turnout.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Dependencies
There are two denpendencies for our program.The first is the **csv** import necessary for us to read the csv file provided by the commission. Second, we have to import the **os** to manipulate the paths in order to open and write/print out results in a text file.

### Execution 
Within the program, we initialize our variables and set them to integer 0 and empty strings. We also created empty lists and dictionarys so we can systematically loop to check/print our election results.
